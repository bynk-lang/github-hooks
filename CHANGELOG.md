## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 3: the service acts as the GitHub App. It welcomes a first-time
  contributor's first issue or pull request with a comment (`embeds/welcome.md`),
  in the repositories `ACTION_REPOS` lists.
  - `AppAuth` signs an RS256 JWT with the App's private key (`APP_PRIVATE_KEY`,
    base64 PKCS#8; `APP_CLIENT_ID`) and exchanges it for an installation token,
    cached in the new `Tokens` KV namespace for 55 minutes.
  - `Bot` runs after the delivery is answered (`~>`), and records each action in
    the new `actions` table (migration `0003`), so a redelivery retries a
    failed action and repeats nothing that worked.
  - A person is welcomed at most once per repository (a `welcomed` table),
    since GitHub reports `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` on every pull request until
    one is merged.
  - A refused comment (`401`/`403`) drops the cached token and retries once
    with a fresh one; a claim left `started` for 10 minutes can be retried.
  - `WELCOME_ASSOCIATIONS` widens who is welcomed, for testing in a sandbox.
  - Setup is in `docs/github-app.md`, step 7.

- A read API, behind a `Reader` actor that accepts an HS256 JWT signed with
  the new `API_TOKEN_SECRET` (`scripts/token.sh` mints one):
  `GET /activity` and `GET /activity/:owner/:name` list the 50 most recent
  deliveries, and `GET /digest/:day` counts one UTC day's by repository, event
  and action. Each read is logged with the reader's name. See
  `docs/read-api.md`.
- Each delivery records GitHub's `deleted` flag (migration `0002`), read only
  from a `push`, so a push that deleted a branch or tag can be told apart; the
  digest leaves those out.

### Changed

- The digest's day handling uses `Instant.fromIso`, which already knows which
  dates exist, and queries the exact range from the day's first instant to the
  next day's (`start + 1.days`). This replaces a hand-written leap-year check
  and a string trick for the range's end; behaviour is unchanged.
- A read whose rows don't decode now logs why, from the `JsonError`'s kind,
  path and message (`StructuralMismatch at $[0].size: …`), not only that it
  failed.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` reads `APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (and, to check the read API,
  `API_TOKEN_SECRET`) from the environment instead of its arguments, and signs
  with Node, so no secret appears in a process's arguments.
- **Deploying needs `API_TOKEN_SECRET`** as well as `APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. A
  deploy without it fails, naming it.

### Fixed

- `installation` and `installation_repositories` deliveries now record the
  organisation, from the installation's `account`. Those events have no
  top-level `organization`, so the `org` column was empty for them. No other
  event uses the installation's account, and an account without a `login` is
  recorded with an empty `org` rather than refused.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

Phase 1: receive, verify and record every delivery from the `bynk-lang` GitHub
App.

### Added

- `POST /github` receives the App's webhook deliveries. The compiler-generated
  `Signature` check verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` (HMAC-SHA256 over the raw
  body, compared in constant time) before the handler runs, and answers `401`
  to anything unsigned or forged. The Worker reads the App's webhook secret
  from `APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (not a `GITHUB_` name, which GitHub Actions
  refuses for secrets).
- Each delivery is recorded as one row in the `github-hooks-deliveries` D1
  database: GitHub's delivery id and event name, plus the `action`,
  repository, sender, organisation and installation every event shares, and
  the payload's size.
- Redeliveries are harmless: the delivery id is the key, so a delivery GitHub
  sends again is answered `200 duplicate` and not recorded twice. Any other
  database failure is logged and answered `500`, so GitHub can redeliver it.
- A missing or empty `X-GitHub-Event` or `X-GitHub-Delivery` header, or a body
  that isn't JSON, is answered `400`.
- `GET /` describes the service.
- Tests at every tier: the pure decoding, the handler against an in-memory D1,
  and the deployable Worker's signature check. `scripts/smoke.sh` sends
  GitHub-signed deliveries to a running Worker, and CI runs both against a
  pinned, checksum-verified Bynk release (v0.492.1).
- `docs/github-app.md`: registering, permissioning and installing the App.
